initially, I cloed a disk and created new physical disk named sdb to start

1. Create a volume group, and set 16M as extends.

fisrt I created a physical resource by fdisk to create a partion sdb1

$ fdisk /dev/sdb

>n #new partion
>p #partion type choesd primary by default just enter
>1 #partion number 1 by default the first partioned to be created 
>2048 #first sector to start chosed default
>20971519 #second sector end with chosed by default

>t #(change partion type) 
>8e #linux LVM

>w #save 
>q #exit

create physical volumn

$ pvcreate /dev/sdb1

crete volume group set to 16 M

$ vgcreate -s 16M VG /dev/sdb1
$ vgdisplay

2. And divided a volume group containing 50 extends on
volume group lv,

$ lvcreate -l 50 -n VL VG

3. make it as ext4 file system,

mkfs -t ext4 /dev/VG/VL
 
4. and mounted automatically under /mnt/data

$ nano /etc/fstam

>/dev/VG/VL /mnt/mydata ext4 defaults 1 2
>^s ^x

mount -a

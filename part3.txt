#private key not used


Part 3: SSH
Generate SSH key and connect to different VM without password.

SSH Scure Shell Protocol
open a remote terminal session on server with a secure communication 

to make the connection we need to use the command
#ssh username@IPaddress -p [if a port other than 22]

but with this configure we need to write the password every time we need to remotely administrat a server

we can make a connection without writting the password eery time and keep the connection secure
by SSH key pair
the SSH have 2 files 
one private Key which it cant be shared with anyone
the other the public key file can be accessed by everyone

we can do this by 

#ssh-keygen
> the file location where to save the key (/root/.ssh/[name])

>passphrase (Kept it empty)

then we can see the files in 

#cd ~/.ssh
#ls -l

register the private ssh key file
first verifying the ssh authintication agent 

#eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

now register the private ssh key file

#ssh-add ~/.ssh/name

we can display the public key 

#cat ~/.ssh/name.pub

we copy the output key and configure it to the other server 
or use the following command

#ssh-copy-id -i name.pub username@IPaddress

now everything is set 
we can login via ssh without entrting a password

#ssh username@IPaddress

//////

SSH using private key 

#ssh username@IPaddress

Part 2: users, groups and permissions

1- Add user: user1, set uid=601 Password: redhat. The user's login shell should be
non-interactive. (no ssh access to server)

#useradd user1 -u 601 -s /sbin/nologin

useradd command to add a new user with name user 1 
the -u option was add to defin the userid for user 1 which it is 601
the -s option it is a shell option, login shell of the new account, nologin to make it noninteractive

#id user1 

to view the UID if it was configured right

#cat /etc/passwd |grep user1

cat to view the content of /etc/passwd file which is contain information about all the users in the system, so I used grep to filter and display onlhy the information about user1

2- Add user1 to group TrainingGroup.

#groupadd TrainingGroup
#usermod -aG TrainingGroup user1

to modify an existing user I used usermod with option -a to append and -G to a Group then specified the group name then specified the user I needed to modified

3- Add users: user2, user3. The Additional group of the two users: user2, user3 is the admin
group Password: redhat, user 3 with root permissions

#groupadd admin
#getent group admin
#useradd user2 -G 30004 
#passwd user2
>redhat
#id user2 

after creating a new group with admin name getent used to get the group id number 
the a new user was created and -g option was used to configure group id with the number that was found from gatent
then passwd command was used to set password 

#useradd -ou 0 -g 0 -G 30004 user3
#passwd user3
>redhat

a new user was created -o option to allow crete duplicate and setted the -u (UID) and -g (GID) to 0 to give it root privilages then set the passwd

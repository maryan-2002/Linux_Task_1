Part 5: permissions
SELinux must be running in the Enforcing mode (permanent even after reboot).

we can display the current SELinux mode by 

#getenforce 

we can change the mode temporary by 

#setenforce 0 >> permissive
#serenforce 1 >> enforcing 

but to change it parmantly 
 set the default SELinux mode 
	with the configuration file that determine
and we can see it in the followin location

#nano /etc/selinux/config.

> we search for line 
> SELINUX=enforcing

if its other than enforcing change it to enforcing

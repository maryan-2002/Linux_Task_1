Part 9: Cronjob
Create a cronjob that will run at 1:30 AM every day and collect the users logged in and save them in a file
Format : timestamp â€“ users
Note: the cronjob can run a script.

# 30 1 * * * CMD

# 30 min
# 1 hour a am 
# * every day
# * every month
# * every day of the weak
# CMD command to be executed

#timestamp: {%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S}]\$

30 1 * * * /usr/bin/w | awk '{print strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"), $1}'  > /root/temp.log

30 1 * * * last | awk '{print strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"), $1}'  > /root/temp.log


#The last command searches back through the file /var/log/wtmp (or the file designated by the -f flag)
# and displays a list of all users logged in (and out) since that file was created. 


#30 1 * * * /usr/bin/w | awk '{print strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"), $1}' | grep -v 'USER' > /root/Linux_Task_1/logged_in_users.log

# /usr/bin/w : shows who is logged on and what they are doing.

# awk '{print strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"), $1}'
# :  formats the output to a timestamp and the user name.
